Psalm 37:16  Their sword shall go through their own heart, and their bow shall be broken.

Psalm 37:25  If they stumble, they shall not fall headlong, for the LORD holds them by the hand.
Psalm 37:26  I have been young and now I am old, but never have I seen the righteous forsaken, or their children begging bread.
Psalm 37:27  The righteous are always generous in their lending, and their children shall be a blessing.
Psalm 37:28  Turn from evil, and do good, and dwell in the land for ever.

Psalm 37:37  I have seen the wicked in their arrogance, flourishing like a tree in full leaf.
Psalm 37:38  I went by, and behold, they were not there; I searched for them, but they could not be found.
Psalm 37:39  Mark those who are honest; observe the upright; for there is a future for the peaceable.
Psalm 37:40  Transgressors shall be destroyed, one and all; the future of the wicked is cut off.

Psalm 38:1  O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger; do not punish me in your wrath.
Psalm 38:2  For your arrows have already pierced me, and your hand presses hard upon me.
Psalm 38:3  There is no health in my flesh, because of your indignation; there is no soundness in my body, because of my sin.
Psalm 38:4  For my iniquities overwhelm me; like a heavy burden they are too much for me to bear.
Psalm 38:5  My wounds stink and fester by reason of my foolishness.
Psalm 38:6  I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; I go about in mourning all the day long.
Psalm 38:7  My loins are filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body.
Psalm 38:8  I am utterly numb and crushed; I wail, because of the groaning of my heart.
Psalm 38:9  O Lord, you know all my desires, and my sighing is not hidden from you.
Psalm 38:10  My heart is pounding, my strength has failed me, and the brightness of my eyes is gone from me.
Psalm 38:11  My friends and companions draw back from my affliction; my neighbors stand afar off.
Psalm 38:12  Those who seek after my life lay snares for me; those who strive to hurt me speak of my ruin and plot treachery all the day long.
Psalm 38:13  But I am like the deaf who do not hear, like those who are mute and do not open their mouth.
Psalm 38:14  I have become like one who does not hear and from whose mouth comes no defense.
Psalm 38:15  For in you, O LORD, have I fixed my hope; you will answer me, O Lord my God.
Psalm 38:16  For I said, “Do not let them rejoice at my expense, those who gloat over me when my foot slips.”
Psalm 38:17  Truly, I am on the verge of falling, and my pain is always with me.
Psalm 38:18  I will confess my iniquity and be sorry for my sin.

Psalm 39:1  I said, “I will keep watch upon my ways, so that I do not offend with my tongue.
Psalm 39:2  I will put a muzzle on my mouth while the wicked are in my presence.”
Psalm 39:3  So I held my tongue and said nothing; I refrained from rash words; but my pain became unbearable.
Psalm 39:4  My heart was hot within me; while I pondered, the fire burst into flame; I spoke out with my tongue:
Psalm 39:5  LORD, let me know my end and the number of my days, so that I may know how short my life is.
Psalm 39:6  You have given me a mere handful of days, and my lifetime is as nothing in your sight; truly, even those who stand erect are but a puff of wind.
Psalm 39:7  We walk about like a shadow, and in vain we are in turmoil; we heap up riches and cannot tell who will gather them.
Psalm 39:8  And now, what is my hope? O Lord, my hope is in you.
Psalm 39:9  Deliver me from all my transgressions and do not make me the taunt of the fool.
Psalm 39:10  I fell silent and did not open my mouth, for surely it was you that did it.
Psalm 39:11  Take your affliction from me; I am worn down by the blows of your hand.
Psalm 39:12  With rebukes for sin you punish us; like a moth you eat away all that is dear to us; truly, everyone is but a puff of wind.
Psalm 39:13  Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears.
Psalm 39:14  For I am but a sojourner with you, a wayfarer, as all my forebears were.
Psalm 39:15  Turn your gaze from me, that I may be glad again, before I go my way and am no more.
Psalm 40:1  I waited patiently upon the LORD; he stooped to me and heard my cry.
Psalm 40:2  He lifted me out of the desolate pit, out of the mire and clay; he set my feet upon a high cliff and made my footing sure.
Psalm 40:3  He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; many shall see, and stand in awe, and put their trust in the LORD.
Psalm 40:4  Happy are they who trust in the LORD! they do not resort to evil spirits or turn to false gods.
Psalm 40:5  Great things are they that you have done, O LORD my God! how great your wonders and your plans for us! there is none who can be compared with you.
Psalm 40:6  Oh, that I could make them known and tell them! but they are more than I can count.
Psalm 40:7  In sacrifice and offering you take no pleasure (you have given me ears to hear you);
Psalm 40:8  Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required, and so I said, “Behold, I come.
Psalm 40:9  In the roll of the book it is written concerning me: ‘I love to do your will, O my God; your law is deep in my heart.’”
Psalm 40:10  I proclaimed righteousness in the great congregation; behold, I did not restrain my lips; and that, O LORD, you know.
Psalm 40:11  Your righteousness have I not hidden in my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your deliverance; I have not concealed your love and faithfulness from the great congregation.
Psalm 40:12  You are the LORD; do not withhold your compassion from me; let your love and your faithfulness keep me safe for ever,
Psalm 40:13  For innumerable troubles have crowded upon me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see; they are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails me.
Psalm 40:14  Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.
Psalm 40:15  Let them be ashamed and altogether dismayed who seek after my life to destroy it; let them draw back and be disgraced who take pleasure in my misfortune.
Psalm 40:16  Let those who say “Aha!” and gloat over me be confounded, because they are ashamed.
Psalm 40:17  Let all who seek you rejoice in you and be glad; let those who love your salvation continually say, “Great is the LORD!”
Psalm 40:18  Though I am poor and afflicted, the Lord will have regard for me.
Psalm 40:19  You are my helper and my deliverer; do not tarry, O my God.
Psalm 41:1  Happy are they who consider the poor and needy! the LORD will deliver them in the time of trouble.
Psalm 41:2  The LORD preserves them and keeps them alive, so that they may be happy in the land; he does not hand them over to the will of their enemies.
Psalm 41:3  The LORD sustains them on their sickbed and ministers to them in their illness.
Psalm 41:4  I said, “LORD, be merciful to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
Psalm 41:5  My enemies are saying wicked things about me: “When will he die, and his name perish?”
Psalm 41:6  Even if they come to see me, they speak empty words; their heart collects false rumors; they go outside and spread them.
Psalm 41:7  All my enemies whisper together about me and devise evil against me.
Psalm 41:8  “A deadly thing,” they say, “has fastened on him; he has taken to his bed and will never get up again.”
Psalm 41:9  Even my best friend, whom I trusted, who broke bread with me, has lifted up his heel and turned against me.
Psalm 41:10  But you, O LORD, be merciful to me and raise me up, and I shall repay them.
Psalm 41:11  By this I know you are pleased with me, that my enemy does not triumph over me.
Psalm 41:12  In my integrity you hold me fast, and shall set me before your face for ever.
Psalm 41:13  Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from age to age. Amen. Amen.
Psalm 42:1  As the deer longs for the water-brooks, so longs my soul for you, O God.
Psalm 42:2  My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God; when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?
Psalm 42:3  My tears have been my food day and night, while all day long they say to me, “Where now is your God?”
Psalm 42:4  I pour out my soul when I think on these things; how I went with the multitude and led them into the house of God,
Psalm 42:5  With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, among those who keep holy-day.
Psalm 42:6  Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? and why are you so disquieted within me?
Psalm 42:7  Put your trust in God; for I will yet give thanks to him, who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
Psalm 42:8  My soul is heavy within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan, and from the peak of Mizar among the heights of Hermon.
Psalm 42:9  One deep calls to another in the noise of your cataracts; all your rapids and floods have gone over me.
Psalm 42:10  The LORD grants his loving-kindness in the daytime; in the night season his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
Psalm 42:11  I will say to the God of my strength, “Why have you forgotten me? and why do I go so heavily while the enemy oppresses me?”
Psalm 42:12  While my bones are being broken, my enemies mock me to my face;
Psalm 42:13  All day long they mock me and say to me, “Where now is your God?”
Psalm 42:14  Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? and why are you so disquieted within me?
Psalm 42:15  Put your trust in God; for I will yet give thanks to him, who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
Psalm 43:1  Give judgment for me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly people; deliver me from the deceitful and the wicked.
Psalm 43:2  For you are the God of my strength; why have you put me from you? and why do I go so heavily while the enemy oppresses me?
Psalm 43:3  Send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, and bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling;
Psalm 43:4  That I may go to the altar of God, to the God of my joy and gladness; and on the harp I will give thanks to you, O God my God.
Psalm 43:5  Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? and why are you so disquieted within me?
Psalm 43:6  Put your trust in God; for I will yet give thanks to him, who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
Psalm 44:1  We have heard with our ears, O God, our forefathers have told us, the deeds you did in their days, in the days of old.
Psalm 44:2  How with your hand you drove the peoples out and planted our forefathers in the land; how you destroyed nations and made your people flourish.
Psalm 44:3  For they did not take the land by their sword, nor did their arm win the victory for them; but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your countenance, because you favored them.
Psalm 44:4  You are my King and my God; you command victories for Jacob.
Psalm 44:5  Through you we pushed back our adversaries; through your Name we trampled on those who rose up against us.
Psalm 44:6  For I do not rely on my bow, and my sword does not give me the victory.
Psalm 44:7  Surely, you gave us victory over our adversaries and put those who hate us to shame.
Psalm 44:8  Every day we gloried in God, and we will praise your Name for ever.
Psalm 44:9  Nevertheless, you have rejected and humbled us and do not go forth with our armies.
Psalm 44:10  You have made us fall back before our adversary, and our enemies have plundered us.
Psalm 44:11  You have made us like sheep to be eaten and have scattered us among the nations.
Psalm 44:12  You are selling your people for a trifle and are making no profit on the sale of them.
Psalm 44:13  You have made us the scorn of our neighbors, a mockery and derision to those around us.
Psalm 44:14  You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughing-stock among the peoples.
Psalm 44:15  My humiliation is daily before me, and shame has covered my face;
Psalm 44:16  Because of the taunts of the mockers and blasphemers, because of the enemy and avenger.
Psalm 44:17  All this has come upon us; yet we have not forgotten you, nor have we betrayed your covenant.
Psalm 44:18  Our heart never turned back, nor did our footsteps stray from your path;
Psalm 44:19  Though you thrust us down into a place of misery, and covered us over with deep darkness.
Psalm 44:20  If we have forgotten the Name of our God, or stretched out our hands to some strange god,
Psalm 44:21  Will not God find it out? for he knows the secrets of the heart.
Psalm 44:22  Indeed, for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
Psalm 44:23  Awake, O Lord! why are you sleeping? Arise! do not reject us for ever.
Psalm 44:24  Why have you hidden your face and forgotten our affliction and oppression?
Psalm 44:25  We sink down into the dust; our body cleaves to the ground.
Psalm 44:26  Rise up, and help us, and save us, for the sake of your steadfast love.

Psalm 49:2  My mouth shall speak of wisdom, and my heart shall meditate on understanding.
Psalm 49:3  I will incline my ear to a proverb and set forth my riddle upon the harp.
Psalm 49:4  Why should I be afraid in evil days, when the wickedness of those at my heels surrounds me,
Psalm 49:5  The wickedness of those who put their trust in their goods, and boast of their great riches?
Psalm 49:6  We can never ransom ourselves, or deliver to God the price of our life;
Psalm 49:7  For the ransom of our life is so great, that we should never have enough to pay it,
Psalm 49:8  In order to live for ever and ever, and never see the grave.
Psalm 49:9  For we see that the wise die also; like the dull and stupid they perish and leave their wealth to those who come after them.
Psalm 49:10  Their graves shall be their homes for ever, their dwelling places from generation to generation, though they call the lands after their own names.
Psalm 49:11  Even though honored, they cannot live for ever; they are like the beasts that perish.
Psalm 49:12  Such is the way of those who foolishly trust in themselves, and the end of those who delight in their own words.
Psalm 49:13  Like a flock of sheep they are destined to die; Death is their shepherd; they go down straightway to the grave.
Psalm 49:14  Their form shall waste away, and the land of the dead shall be their home.
Psalm 49:15  But God will ransom my life; he will snatch me from the grasp of death.
Psalm 49:16  Do not be envious when some become rich, or when the grandeur of their house increases;
Psalm 49:17  For they will carry nothing away at their death, nor will their grandeur follow them.
Psalm 49:18  Though they thought highly of themselves while they lived, and were praised for their success,
Psalm 49:19  They shall join the company of their forebears, who will never see the light again.
Psalm 49:20  Those who are honored, but have no understanding, are like the beasts that perish.

Psalm 50:4  He calls the heavens and the earth from above to witness the judgment of his people.
Psalm 50:5  “Gather before me my loyal followers, those who have made a covenant with me and sealed it with sacrifice.”
Psalm 50:6  Let the heavens declare the rightness of his cause; for God himself is judge.
Psalm 50:7  Hear, O my people, and I will speak: “O Israel, I will bear witness against you; for I am God, your God.
Psalm 50:8  I do not accuse you because of your sacrifices; your offerings are always before me.
Psalm 50:9  I will take no bull-calf from your stalls, nor he-goats out of your pens;
Psalm 50:10  For all the beasts of the forest are mine, the herds in their thousands upon the hills.
Psalm 50:11  I know every bird in the sky, and the creatures of the fields are in my sight.
Psalm 50:12  If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the whole world is mine and all that is in it.
Psalm 50:13  Do you think I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
Psalm 50:14  Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving and make good your vows to the Most High.
Psalm 50:15  Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall honor me.”
Psalm 50:16  But to the wicked God says: “Why do you recite my statutes, and take my covenant upon your lips;
Psalm 50:17  Since you refuse discipline, and toss my words behind your back?
Psalm 50:18  When you see a thief, you make him your friend, and you cast in your lot with adulterers.
Psalm 50:19  You have loosed your lips for evil, and harnessed your tongue to a lie.
Psalm 50:20  You are always speaking evil of your brother and slandering your own mother’s son.
Psalm 50:21  These things you have done, and I kept still, and you thought that I am like you.”
Psalm 50:22  “I have made my accusation; I have put my case in order before your eyes.
Psalm 50:23  Consider this well, you who forget God, lest I rend you and there be none to deliver you.
Psalm 50:24  Whoever offers me the sacrifice of thanksgiving honors me; but to those who keep in my way will I show the salvation of God.”
Psalm 51:1  Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness; in your great compassion blot out my offenses.
Psalm 51:2  Wash me through and through from my wickedness and cleanse me from my sin.
Psalm 51:3  For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
Psalm 51:4  Against you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.
Psalm 51:5  And so you are justified when you speak and upright in your judgment.
Psalm 51:6  Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, a sinner from my mother’s womb.
Psalm 51:7  For behold, you look for truth deep within me, and will make me understand wisdom secretly.
Psalm 51:8  Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; wash me, and I shall be clean indeed.
Psalm 51:9  Make me hear of joy and gladness, that the body you have broken may rejoice.
Psalm 51:10  Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Psalm 51:11  Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
Psalm 51:12  Cast me not away from your presence and take not your holy Spirit from me.
Psalm 51:13  Give me the joy of your saving help again and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.
Psalm 51:14  I shall teach your ways to the wicked, and sinners shall return to you.
Psalm 51:15  Deliver me from death, O God, and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness, O God of my salvation.
Psalm 51:16  Open my lips, O Lord, and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.
Psalm 51:17  Had you desired it, I would have offered sacrifice, but you take no delight in burnt-offerings.
Psalm 51:18  The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
Psalm 51:19  Be favorable and gracious to Zion, and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
Psalm 51:20  Then you will be pleased with the appointed sacrifices, with burnt-offerings and oblations; then shall they offer young bullocks upon your altar.
Psalm 52:1  You tyrant, why do you boast of wickedness against the godly all day long?
Psalm 52:2  You plot ruin; your tongue is like a sharpened razor, O worker of deception.
Psalm 52:3  You love evil more than good and lying more than speaking the truth.
Psalm 52:4  You love all words that hurt, O you deceitful tongue.
Psalm 52:5  Oh, that God would demolish you utterly, topple you, and snatch you from your dwelling, and root you out of the land of the living!

Psalm 70:4  Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation say for ever, “Great is the LORD!”
Psalm 70:5  But as for me, I am poor and needy; come to me speedily, O God.
Psalm 70:6  You are my helper and my deliverer; O LORD, do not tarry.
Psalm 71:1  In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge; let me never be ashamed.
Psalm 71:2  In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; incline your ear to me and save me.
Psalm 71:3  Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; you are my crag and my stronghold.
Psalm 71:4  Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.
Psalm 71:5  For you are my hope, O LORD God, my confidence since I was young.
Psalm 71:6  I have been sustained by you ever since I was born; from my mother’s womb you have been my strength; my praise shall be always of you.
Psalm 71:7  I have become a portent to many; but you are my refuge and my strength.
Psalm 71:8  Let my mouth be full of your praise and your glory all the day long.
Psalm 71:9  Do not cast me off in my old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.
Psalm 71:10  For my enemies are talking against me, and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.
Psalm 71:11  They say, “God has forsaken him; go after him and seize him; because there is none who will save.”
Psalm 71:12  O God, be not far from me; come quickly to help me, O my God.
Psalm 71:13  Let those who set themselves against me be put to shame and be disgraced; let those who seek to do me evil be covered with scorn and reproach.
Psalm 71:14  But I shall always wait in patience, and shall praise you more and more.
Psalm 71:15  My mouth shall recount your mighty acts and saving deeds all day long; though I cannot know the number of them.
Psalm 71:16  I will begin with the mighty works of the Lord GOD; I will recall your righteousness, yours alone.
Psalm 71:17  O God, you have taught me since I was young, and to this day I tell of your wonderful works.
Psalm 71:18  And now that I am old and gray-headed, O God, do not forsake me, till I make known your strength to this generation and your power to all who are to come.
Psalm 71:19  Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens; you have done great things; who is like you, O God?
Psalm 71:20  You have showed me great troubles and adversities, but you will restore my life and bring me up again from the deep places of the earth.
Psalm 71:21  You strengthen me more and more; you enfold and comfort me,
Psalm 71:22  Therefore I will praise you upon the lyre for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing to you with the harp, O Holy One of Israel.
Psalm 71:23  My lips will sing with joy when I play to you, and so will my soul, which you have redeemed.
Psalm 71:24  My tongue will proclaim your righteousness all day long, for they are ashamed and disgraced who sought to do me harm.
Psalm 72:1  Give the King your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the King’s Son;
Psalm 72:2  That he may rule your people righteously and the poor with justice.
Psalm 72:3  That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, and the little hills bring righteousness.
Psalm 72:4  He shall defend the needy among the people; he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.
Psalm 72:5  He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, from one generation to another.
Psalm 72:6  He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, like showers that water the earth.
Psalm 72:7  In his time shall the righteous flourish; there shall be abundance of peace till the moon shall be no more.
Psalm 72:8  He shall rule from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Psalm 72:9  His foes shall bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust.
Psalm 72:10  The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall pay tribute, and the kings of Arabia and Saba offer gifts.
Psalm 72:11  All kings shall bow down before him, and all the nations do him service.
Psalm 72:12  For he shall deliver the poor who cries out in distress, and the oppressed who has no helper.
Psalm 72:13  He shall have pity on the lowly and poor; he shall preserve the lives of the needy.
Psalm 72:14  He shall redeem their lives from oppression and violence, and dear shall their blood be in his sight.
Psalm 72:15  Long may he live! and may there be given to him gold from Arabia; may prayer be made for him always, and may they bless him all the day long.
Psalm 72:16  May there be abundance of grain on the earth, growing thick even on the hilltops; may its fruit flourish like Lebanon, and its grain like grass upon the earth.
Psalm 72:17  May his Name remain for ever and be established as long as the sun endures; may all the nations bless themselves in him and call him blessed.
Psalm 72:18  Blessed be the Lord GOD, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous deeds!
Psalm 72:19  And blessed be his glorious Name for ever! and may all the earth be filled with his glory. Amen. Amen.
Psalm 73:1  Truly, God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
Psalm 73:2  But as for me, my feet had nearly slipped; I had almost tripped and fallen;
Psalm 73:3  Because I envied the proud and saw the prosperity of the wicked:
Psalm 73:4  For they suffer no pain, and their bodies are sleek and sound;
Psalm 73:5  In the misfortunes of others they have no share; they are not afflicted as others are;
Psalm 73:6  Therefore they wear their pride like a necklace and wrap their violence about them like a cloak.
Psalm 73:7  Their iniquity comes from gross minds, and their hearts overflow with wicked thoughts.
Psalm 73:8  They scoff and speak maliciously; out of their haughtiness they plan oppression.
Psalm 73:9  They set their mouths against the heavens, and their evil speech runs through the world.
Psalm 73:10  And so the people turn to them and find in them no fault.
Psalm 73:11  They say, “How should God know? is there knowledge in the Most High?”
Psalm 73:12  So then, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase their wealth.
Psalm 73:13  In vain have I kept my heart clean, and washed my hands in innocence.
Psalm 73:14  I have been afflicted all day long, and punished every morning.
Psalm 73:15  Had I gone on speaking this way, I should have betrayed the generation of your children.
Psalm 73:16  When I tried to understand these things, it was too hard for me;
Psalm 73:17  Until I entered the sanctuary of God and discerned the end of the wicked.
Psalm 73:18  Surely, you set them in slippery places; you cast them down in ruin.
Psalm 73:19  Oh, how suddenly do they come to destruction, come to an end, and perish from terror!
Psalm 73:20  Like a dream when one awakens, O Lord, when you arise you will make their image vanish.
Psalm 73:21  When my mind became embittered, I was sorely wounded in my heart.
Psalm 73:22  I was stupid and had no understanding; I was like a brute beast in your presence.
Psalm 73:23  Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.
Psalm 73:24  You will guide me by your counsel, and afterwards receive me with glory.
Psalm 73:25  Whom have I in heaven but you? and having you I desire nothing upon earth.
Psalm 73:26  Though my flesh and my heart should waste away, God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
Psalm 73:27  Truly, those who forsake you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful.
Psalm 73:28  But it is good for me to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge.
Psalm 73:29  I will speak of all your works in the gates of the city of Zion.
Psalm 74:1  O God, why have you utterly cast us off? why is your wrath so hot against the sheep of your pasture?
Psalm 74:2  Remember your congregation that you purchased long ago, the tribe you redeemed to be your inheritance, and Mount Zion where you dwell.
Psalm 74:3  Turn your steps toward the endless ruins; the enemy has laid waste everything in your sanctuary.
Psalm 74:4  Your adversaries roared in your holy place; they set up their banners as tokens of victory.
Psalm 74:5  They were like men coming up with axes to a grove of trees; they broke down all your carved work with hatchets and hammers.
Psalm 74:6  They set fire to your holy place; they defiled the dwelling-place of your Name and razed it to the ground.
Psalm 74:7  They said to themselves, “Let us destroy them altogether.” They burned down all the meeting-places of God in the land.
Psalm 74:8  There are no signs for us to see; there is no prophet left; there is not one among us who knows how long.
Psalm 74:9  How long, O God, will the adversary scoff? will the enemy blaspheme your Name for ever?
Psalm 74:10  Why do you draw back your hand? why is your right hand hidden in your bosom?
Psalm 74:11  Yet God is my King from ancient times, victorious in the midst of the earth.
Psalm 74:12  You divided the sea by your might and shattered the heads of the dragons upon the waters;
Psalm 74:13  You crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him to the people of the desert for food.
Psalm 74:14  You split open spring and torrent; you dried up ever-flowing rivers.
Psalm 74:15  Yours is the day, yours also the night; you established the moon and the sun.
Psalm 74:16  You fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.
Psalm 74:17  Remember, O Lord, how the enemy scoffed, how a foolish people despised your Name.
Psalm 74:18  Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; never forget the lives of your poor.
Psalm 74:19  Look upon your covenant; the dark places of the earth are haunts of violence.
Psalm 74:20  Let not the oppressed turn away ashamed; let the poor and needy praise your Name.
Psalm 74:21  Arise, O God, maintain your cause; remember how fools revile you all day long.
Psalm 74:22  Forget not the clamor of your adversaries, the unending tumult of those who rise up against you.
Psalm 75:1  We give you thanks, O God, we give you thanks, calling upon your Name and declaring all your wonderful deeds.
Psalm 75:2  “I will appoint a time,” says God; “I will judge with equity.
Psalm 75:3  Though the earth and all its inhabitants are quaking, I will make its pillars fast.
Psalm 75:4  I will say to the boasters, ‘Boast no more,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not toss your horns;
Psalm 75:5  Do not toss your horns so high, nor speak with a proud neck.’”
Psalm 75:6  For judgment is neither from the east nor from the west, nor yet from the wilderness or the mountains.
Psalm 75:7  It is God who judges; he puts down one and lifts up another.
Psalm 75:8  For in the LORD’S hand there is a cup, full of spiced and foaming wine, which he pours out, and all the wicked of the earth shall drink and drain the dregs.
Psalm 75:9  But I will rejoice for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
Psalm 75:10  He shall break off all the horns of the wicked; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
Psalm 76:1  In Judah is God known; his Name is great in Israel.
Psalm 76:2  At Salem is his tabernacle, and his dwelling is in Zion.
Psalm 76:3  There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of battle.
Psalm 76:4  How glorious you are! more splendid than the everlasting mountains!
Psalm 76:5  The strong of heart have been despoiled; they sink into sleep; none of the warriors can lift a hand.
Psalm 76:6  At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and rider lie stunned.
Psalm 76:7  What terror you inspire! who can stand before you when you are angry?
Psalm 76:8  From heaven you pronounced judgment; the earth was afraid and was still;
Psalm 76:9  When God rose up to judgment and to save all the oppressed of the earth.
Psalm 76:10  Truly, wrathful Edom will give you thanks, and the remnant of Hamath will keep your feasts.
Psalm 76:11  Make a vow to the LORD your God and keep it; let all around him bring gifts to him who is worthy to be feared.
Psalm 76:12  He breaks the spirit of princes, and strikes terror in the kings of the earth.
Psalm 77:1  I will cry aloud to God; I will cry aloud, and he will hear me.
Psalm 77:2  In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; my hands were stretched out by night and did not tire; I refused to be comforted.
Psalm 77:3  I think of God, I am restless, I ponder, and my spirit faints.
Psalm 77:4  You will not let my eyelids close; I am troubled and I cannot speak.
Psalm 77:5  I consider the days of old; I remember the years long past;
Psalm 77:6  I commune with my heart in the night; I ponder and search my mind.
Psalm 77:7  Will the Lord cast me off for ever? will he no more show his favor?
Psalm 77:8  Has his loving-kindness come to an end for ever? has his promise failed for evermore?
Psalm 77:9  Has God forgotten to be gracious? has he, in his anger, withheld his compassion?
Psalm 77:10  And I said, “My grief is this: the right hand of the Most High has lost its power.”
Psalm 77:11  I will remember the works of the LORD, and call to mind your wonders of old time.
Psalm 77:12  I will meditate on all your acts and ponder your mighty deeds.
Psalm 77:13  Your way, O God, is holy; who is so great a god as our God?
Psalm 77:14  You are the God who works wonders and have declared your power among the peoples.
Psalm 77:15  By your strength you have redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph.
Psalm 77:16  The waters saw you, O God; the waters saw you and trembled; the very depths were shaken.
Psalm 77:17  The clouds poured out water; the skies thundered; your arrows flashed to and fro;
Psalm 77:18  The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
Psalm 77:19  Your way was in the sea, and your paths in the great waters, yet your footsteps were not seen.
Psalm 77:20  You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psalm 78:1  Hear my teaching, O my people; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psalm 78:2  I will open my mouth in a parable; I will declare the mysteries of ancient times.
Psalm 78:3  That which we have heard and known, and what our forefathers have told us, we will not hide from their children.
Psalm 78:4  We will recount to generations to come the praiseworthy deeds and the power of the LORD, and the wonderful works he has done.
Psalm 78:5  He gave his decrees to Jacob and established a law for Israel, which he commanded them to teach their children;
Psalm 78:6  That the generations to come might know, and the children yet unborn; that they in their turn might tell it to their children;
Psalm 78:7  So that they might put their trust in God, and not forget the deeds of God, but keep his commandments;
Psalm 78:8  And not be like their forefathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
Psalm 78:9  The people of Ephraim, armed with the bow, turned back in the day of battle;
Psalm 78:10  They did not keep the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
Psalm 78:11  They forgot what he had done, and the wonders he had shown them.
Psalm 78:12  He worked marvels in the sight of their forefathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
Psalm 78:13  He split open the sea and let them pass through; he made the waters stand up like walls.
Psalm 78:14  He led them with a cloud by day, and all the night through with a glow of fire.
Psalm 78:15  He split the hard rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as from the great deep.
Psalm 78:16  He brought streams out of the cliff, and the waters gushed out like rivers.
Psalm 78:17  But they went on sinning against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
Psalm 78:18  They tested God in their hearts, demanding food for their craving.
Psalm 78:19  They railed against God and said, “Can God set a table in the wilderness?
Psalm 78:20  True, he struck the rock, the waters gushed out, and the gullies overflowed; but is he able to give bread or to provide meat for his people?”
Psalm 78:21  When the LORD heard this, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob, and his anger mounted against Israel;
Psalm 78:22  For they had no faith in God, nor did they put their trust in his saving power.
Psalm 78:23  So he commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven.
Psalm 78:24  He rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them grain from heaven.
Psalm 78:25  So mortals ate the bread of angels; he provided for them food enough.
Psalm 78:26  He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens and led out the south wind by his might.
Psalm 78:27  He rained down flesh upon them like dust and wingèd birds like the sand of the sea.
Psalm 78:28  He let it fall in the midst of their camp and round about their dwellings.
Psalm 78:29  So they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.
Psalm 78:30  But they did not stop their craving, though the food was still in their mouths.
Psalm 78:31  So God’s anger mounted against them; he slew their strongest men and laid low the youth of Israel.
Psalm 78:32  In spite of all this, they went on sinning and had no faith in his wonderful works.
Psalm 78:33  So he brought their days to an end like a breath and their years in sudden terror.
Psalm 78:34  Whenever he slew them, they would seek him, and repent, and diligently search for God.
Psalm 78:35  They would remember that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.
Psalm 78:36  But they flattered him with their mouths and lied to him with their tongues.
Psalm 78:37  Their heart was not steadfast toward him, and they were not faithful to his covenant.
Psalm 78:38  But he was so merciful that he forgave their sins and did not destroy them; many times he held back his anger and did not permit his wrath to be roused.
Psalm 78:39  For he remembered that they were but flesh, a breath that goes forth and does not return.
Psalm 78:40  How often the people disobeyed him in the wilderness and offended him in the desert!
Psalm 78:41  Again and again they tempted God and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
Psalm 78:42  They did not remember his power in the day when he ransomed them from the enemy;
Psalm 78:43  How he wrought his signs in Egypt and his omens in the field of Zoan.
Psalm 78:44  He turned their rivers into blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.
Psalm 78:45  He sent swarms of flies among them, which ate them up, and frogs, which destroyed them.
Psalm 78:46  He gave their crops to the caterpillar, the fruit of their toil to the locust.
Psalm 78:47  He killed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost.
Psalm 78:48  He delivered their cattle to hailstones and their livestock to hot thunderbolts.
Psalm 78:49  He poured out upon them his blazing anger: fury, indignation, and distress, a troop of destroying angels.
Psalm 78:50  He gave full rein to his anger; he did not spare their souls from death; but delivered their lives to the plague.
Psalm 78:51  He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the flower of manhood in the dwellings of Ham.
Psalm 78:52  He led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalm 78:53  He led them to safety, and they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalm 78:54  He brought them to his holy land, the mountain his right hand had won.
Psalm 78:55  He drove out the Canaanites before them and apportioned an inheritance to them by lot; he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalm 78:56  But they tested the Most High God, and defied him, and did not keep his commandments.
Psalm 78:57  They turned away and were disloyal like their fathers; they were undependable like a warped bow.
Psalm 78:58  They grieved him with their hill-altars and provoked his displeasure with their idols.
Psalm 78:59  When God heard this, he was angry and utterly rejected Israel.
Psalm 78:60  He forsook the shrine at Shiloh, the tabernacle where he had lived among his people.
Psalm 78:61  He delivered the ark into captivity, his glory into the adversary’s hand.
Psalm 78:62  He gave his people to the sword and was angered against his inheritance.
Psalm 78:63  The fire consumed their young men; there were no wedding songs for their maidens.
Psalm 78:64  Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
Psalm 78:65  Then the LORD woke as though from sleep, like a warrior refreshed with wine.
Psalm 78:66  He struck his enemies on the backside and put them to perpetual shame.
Psalm 78:67  He rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
Psalm 78:68  He chose instead the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion, which he loved.
Psalm 78:69  He built his sanctuary like the heights of heaven, like the earth which he founded for ever.
Psalm 78:70  He chose David his servant, and took him away from the sheepfolds.
Psalm 78:71  He brought him from following the ewes, to be a shepherd over Jacob his people and over Israel his inheritance.
Psalm 78:72  So he shepherded them with a faithful and true heart and guided them with the skillfulness of his hands.
Psalm 79:1  O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance; they have profaned your holy temple; they have made Jerusalem a heap of rubble.
Psalm 79:2  They have given the bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the air, and the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the field.
Psalm 79:3  They have shed their blood like water on every side of Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
Psalm 79:4  We have become a reproach to our neighbors, an object of scorn and derision to those around us.
Psalm 79:5  How long will you be angry, O LORD? will your fury blaze like fire for ever?
Psalm 79:6  Pour out your wrath upon the heathen who have not known you and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your Name.
Psalm 79:7  For they have devoured Jacob and made his dwelling a ruin.
Psalm 79:8  Remember not our past sins; let your compassion be swift to meet us; for we have been brought very low.
Psalm 79:9  Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your Name; deliver us and forgive us our sins, for your Name’s sake.
Psalm 79:10  Why should the heathen say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the heathen and in our sight that you avenge the shedding of your servants’ blood.
Psalm 79:11  Let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before you, and by your great might spare those who are condemned to die.
Psalm 79:12  May the revilings with which they reviled you, O Lord, return seven-fold into their bosoms.
Psalm 79:13  For we are your people and the sheep of your pasture; we will give you thanks for ever and show forth your praise from age to age.
Psalm 80:1  Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, leading Joseph like a flock; shine forth, you that are enthroned upon the cherubim.
Psalm 80:2  In the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your strength and come to help us.
Psalm 80:3  Restore us, O God of hosts; show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
Psalm 80:4  O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angered despite the prayers of your people?
Psalm 80:5  You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have given them bowls of tears to drink.
Psalm 80:6  You have made us the derision of our neighbors, and our enemies laugh us to scorn.
Psalm 80:7  Restore us, O God of hosts; show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
Psalm 80:8  You have brought a vine out of Egypt; you cast out the nations and planted it.
Psalm 80:9  You prepared the ground for it; it took root and filled the land.
Psalm 80:10  The mountains were covered by its shadow and the towering cedar trees by its boughs.
Psalm 80:11  You stretched out its tendrils to the Sea and its branches to the River.
Psalm 80:12  Why have you broken down its wall, so that all who pass by pluck off its grapes?
Psalm 80:13  The wild boar of the forest has ravaged it, and the beasts of the field have grazed upon it.
Psalm 80:14  Turn now, O God of hosts, look down from heaven; behold and tend this vine; preserve what your right hand has planted.
Psalm 80:15  They burn it with fire like rubbish; at the rebuke of your countenance let them perish.
Psalm 80:16  Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, the son of man you have made so strong for yourself.
Psalm 80:17  And so will we never turn away from you; give us life, that we may call upon your Name.
Psalm 80:18  Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
Psalm 81:1  Sing with joy to God our strength and raise a loud shout to the God of Jacob.
Psalm 81:2  Raise a song and sound the timbrel, the merry harp, and the lyre.
Psalm 81:3  Blow the ram’s-horn at the new moon, and at the full moon, the day of our feast.
Psalm 81:4  For this is a statute for Israel, a law of the God of Jacob.
Psalm 81:5  He laid it as a solemn charge upon Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt.
Psalm 81:6  I heard an unfamiliar voice saying, “I eased his shoulder from the burden; his hands were set free from bearing the load.”
Psalm 81:7  You called on me in trouble, and I saved you; I answered you from the secret place of thunder and tested you at the waters of Meribah.
Psalm 81:8  Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you: O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
Psalm 81:9  There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not worship a foreign god.
Psalm 81:10  I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and said, “Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.”
Psalm 81:11  And yet my people did not hear my voice, and Israel would not obey me.
Psalm 81:12  So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their hearts, to follow their own devices.
Psalm 81:13  Oh, that my people would listen to me! that Israel would walk in my ways!
Psalm 81:14  I should soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes.
Psalm 81:15  Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, and their punishment would last for ever.
Psalm 81:16  But Israel would I feed with the finest wheat and satisfy him with honey from the rock.
Psalm 82:1  God takes his stand in the council of heaven; he gives judgment in the midst of the gods:
Psalm 82:2  “How long will you judge unjustly, and show favor to the wicked?
Psalm 82:3  Save the weak and the orphan; defend the humble and needy;
Psalm 82:4  Rescue the weak and the poor; deliver them from the power of the wicked.
Psalm 82:5  They do not know, neither do they understand; they go about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
Psalm 82:6  Now I say to you, ‘You are gods, and all of you children of the Most High;
Psalm 82:7  Nevertheless, you shall die like mortals, and fall like any prince.’”
Psalm 82:8  Arise, O God, and rule the earth, for you shall take all nations for your own.
Psalm 83:1  O God, do not be silent; do not keep still nor hold your peace, O God;
Psalm 83:2  For your enemies are in tumult, and those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
Psalm 83:3  They take secret counsel against your people and plot against those whom you protect.
Psalm 83:4  They have said, “Come, let us wipe them out from among the nations; let the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
Psalm 83:5  They have conspired together; they have made an alliance against you:
Psalm 83:6  The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; the Moabites and the Hagarenes;
Psalm 83:7  Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines and those who dwell in Tyre.
Psalm 83:8  The Assyrians also have joined them, and have come to help the people of Lot.
Psalm 83:9  Do to them as you did to Midian, to Sisera, and to Jabin at the river of Kishon:
Psalm 83:10  They were destroyed at Endor; they became like dung upon the ground.
Psalm 83:11  Make their leaders like Oreb and Zeëb, and all their commanders like Zebah and Zalmunna,
Psalm 83:12  Who said, “Let us take for ourselves the fields of God as our possession.”
Psalm 83:13  O my God, make them like whirling dust and like chaff before the wind;
Psalm 83:14  Like fire that burns down a forest, like the flame that sets mountains ablaze.
Psalm 83:15  Drive them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm;
Psalm 83:16  Cover their faces with shame, O LORD, that they may seek your Name.
Psalm 83:17  Let them be disgraced and terrified for ever; let them be put to confusion and perish.
Psalm 83:18  Let them know that you, whose Name is YAHWEH, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.

Psalm 85:2  You have forgiven the iniquity of your people and blotted out all their sins.
Psalm 85:3  You have withdrawn all your fury and turned yourself from your wrathful indignation.
Psalm 85:4  Restore us then, O God our Savior; let your anger depart from us.
Psalm 85:5  Will you be displeased with us for ever? will you prolong your anger from age to age?
Psalm 85:6  Will you not give us life again, that your people may rejoice in you?
Psalm 85:7  Show us your mercy, O LORD, and grant us your salvation.
Psalm 85:8  I will listen to what the LORD God is saying, for he is speaking peace to his faithful people and to those who turn their hearts to him.
Psalm 85:9  Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.
Psalm 85:10  Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Psalm 85:11  Truth shall spring up from the earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
Psalm 85:12  The LORD will indeed grant prosperity, and our land will yield its increase.
Psalm 85:13  Righteousness shall go before him, and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.

Psalm 86:13  For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the nethermost Pit.
Psalm 86:14  The arrogant rise up against me, O God, and a band of violent men seeks my life; they have not set you before their eyes.
Psalm 86:15  But you, O LORD, are gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and full of kindness and truth.
Psalm 86:16  Turn to me and have mercy upon me; give your strength to your servant; and save the child of your handmaid.
Psalm 86:17  Show me a sign of your favor, so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed; because you, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
Psalm 87:1  On the holy mountain stands the city he has founded; the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Psalm 87:2  Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of our God.
Psalm 87:3  I count Egypt and Babylon among those who know me; behold Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia: in Zion were they born.
Psalm 87:4  Of Zion it shall be said, “Everyone was born in her, and the Most High himself shall sustain her.”
Psalm 87:5  The LORD will record as he enrolls the peoples, “These also were born there.”
Psalm 87:6  The singers and the dancers will say, “All my fresh springs are in you.”
Psalm 88:1  O LORD, my God, my Savior, by day and night I cry to you.
Psalm 88:2  Let my prayer enter into your presence; incline your ear to my lamentation.
Psalm 88:3  For I am full of trouble; my life is at the brink of the grave.
Psalm 88:4  I am counted among those who go down to the Pit; I have become like one who has no strength;
Psalm 88:5  Lost among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave,
Psalm 88:6  Whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand.
Psalm 88:7  You have laid me in the depths of the Pit, in dark places, and in the abyss.
Psalm 88:8  Your anger weighs upon me heavily, and all your great waves overwhelm me.
Psalm 88:9  You have put my friends far from me; you have made me to be abhorred by them; I am in prison and cannot get free.
Psalm 88:10  My sight has failed me because of trouble; LORD, I have called upon you daily; I have stretched out my hands to you.
Psalm 88:11  Do you work wonders for the dead? will those who have died stand up and give you thanks?
Psalm 88:12  Will your loving-kindness be declared in the grave? your faithfulness in the land of destruction?
Psalm 88:13  Will your wonders be known in the dark? or your righteousness in the country where all is forgotten?
Psalm 88:14  But as for me, O LORD, I cry to you for help; in the morning my prayer comes before you.
Psalm 88:15  LORD, why have you rejected me? why have you hidden your face from me?
Psalm 88:16  Ever since my youth, I have been wretched and at the point of death; I have borne your terrors with a troubled mind.
Psalm 88:17  Your blazing anger has swept over me; your terrors have destroyed me;
Psalm 88:18  They surround me all day long like a flood; they encompass me on every side.
Psalm 88:19  My friend and my neighbor you have put away from me, and darkness is my only companion.
Psalm 89:1  Your love, O LORD, for ever will I sing; from age to age my mouth will proclaim your faithfulness.
Psalm 89:2  For I am persuaded that your love is established for ever; you have set your faithfulness firmly in the heavens.
Psalm 89:3  “I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn an oath to David my servant:
Psalm 89:4  ‘I will establish your line for ever, and preserve your throne for all generations.’”
Psalm 89:5  The heavens bear witness to your wonders, O LORD, and to your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones;

Psalm 89:7  God is much to be feared in the council of the holy ones, great and terrible to all those round about him.
Psalm 89:8  Who is like you, LORD God of hosts? O mighty LORD, your faithfulness is all around you.
Psalm 89:9  You rule the raging of the sea and still the surging of its waves.
Psalm 89:10  You have crushed Rahab of the deep with a deadly wound; you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
Psalm 89:11  Yours are the heavens; the earth also is yours; you laid the foundations of the world and all that is in it.
Psalm 89:12  You have made the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your Name.
Psalm 89:13  You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand and high is your right hand.
Psalm 89:14  Righteousness and justice are the foundations of your throne; love and truth go before your face.
Psalm 89:15  Happy are the people who know the festal shout! they walk, O LORD, in the light of your presence.
Psalm 89:16  They rejoice daily in your Name; they are jubilant in your righteousness.
Psalm 89:17  For you are the glory of their strength, and by your favor our might is exalted.
Psalm 89:18  Truly, the LORD is our ruler; The Holy One of Israel is our King.
Psalm 89:19  You spoke once in a vision and said to your faithful people: “I have set the crown upon a warrior and have exalted one chosen out of the people.
Psalm 89:20  I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him.
Psalm 89:21  My hand will hold him fast and my arm will make him strong.
Psalm 89:22  No enemy shall deceive him, nor any wicked man bring him down.
Psalm 89:23  I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.
Psalm 89:24  My faithfulness and love shall be with him, and he shall be victorious through my Name.
Psalm 89:25  I shall make his dominion extend from the Great Sea to the River.
Psalm 89:26  He will say to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.’
Psalm 89:27  I will make him my firstborn and higher than the kings of the earth.
Psalm 89:28  I will keep my love for him for ever, and my covenant will stand firm for him.
Psalm 89:29  I will establish his line for ever and his throne as the days of heaven.”
Psalm 89:30  “If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my judgments;
Psalm 89:31  If they break my statutes and do not keep my commandments;
Psalm 89:32  I will punish their transgressions with a rod and their iniquities with the lash;
Psalm 89:33  But I will not take my love from him, nor let my faithfulness prove false.
Psalm 89:34  I will not break my covenant, nor change what has gone out of my lips.
Psalm 89:35  Once for all I have sworn by my holiness: ‘I will not lie to David.
Psalm 89:36  His line shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me;
Psalm 89:37  It shall stand fast for evermore like the moon, the abiding witness in the sky.’”
Psalm 89:38  But you have cast off and rejected your anointed; you have become enraged at him.
Psalm 89:39  You have broken your covenant with your servant, defiled his crown, and hurled it to the ground.
Psalm 89:40  You have breached all his walls and laid his strongholds in ruins.
Psalm 89:41  All who pass by despoil him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
Psalm 89:42  You have exalted the right hand of his foes and made all his enemies rejoice.
Psalm 89:43  You have turned back the edge of his sword and have not sustained him in battle.
Psalm 89:44  You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.
Psalm 89:45  You have cut short the days of his youth and have covered him with shame.
Psalm 89:46  How long will you hide yourself, O LORD? will you hide yourself for ever? how long will your anger burn like fire?
Psalm 89:47  Remember, LORD, how short life is, how frail you have made all flesh.
Psalm 89:48  Who can live and not see death? who can save himself from the power of the grave?
Psalm 89:49  Where, Lord, are your loving-kindnesses of old, which you promised David in your faithfulness?
Psalm 89:50  Remember, Lord, how your servant is mocked, how I carry in my bosom the taunts of many peoples,
Psalm 89:51  The taunts your enemies have hurled, O LORD, which they hurled at the heels of your anointed.
Psalm 89:52  Blessed be the LORD for evermore! Amen, I say, Amen.
Psalm 90:1  Lord, you have been our refuge from one generation to another.
Psalm 90:2  Before the mountains were brought forth, or the land and the earth were born, from age to age you are God.
Psalm 90:3  You turn us back to the dust and say, “Go back, O child of earth.”
Psalm 90:4  For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is past and like a watch in the night.
Psalm 90:5  You sweep us away like a dream; we fade away suddenly like the grass.
Psalm 90:6  In the morning it is green and flourishes; in the evening it is dried up and withered.
Psalm 90:7  For we consume away in your displeasure; we are afraid because of your wrathful indignation.
Psalm 90:8  Our iniquities you have set before you, and our secret sins in the light of your countenance.
Psalm 90:9  When you are angry, all our days are gone; we bring our years to an end like a sigh.
Psalm 90:10  The span of our life is seventy years, perhaps in strength even eighty; yet the sum of them is but labor and sorrow, for they pass away quickly and we are gone.
Psalm 90:11  Who regards the power of your wrath? who rightly fears your indignation?
Psalm 90:12  So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.
Psalm 90:13  Return, O LORD; how long will you tarry? be gracious to your servants.
Psalm 90:14  Satisfy us by your loving-kindness in the morning; so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.
Psalm 90:15  Make us glad by the measure of the days that you afflicted us and the years in which we suffered adversity.
Psalm 90:16  Show your servants your works and your splendor to their children.
Psalm 90:17  May the graciousness of the LORD our God be upon us; prosper the work of our hands; prosper our handiwork.

Psalm 91:8  Your eyes have only to behold to see the reward of the wicked.

Psalm 91:11  For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.
Psalm 91:12  They shall bear you in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone.
Psalm 91:13  You shall tread upon the lion and adder; you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.
Psalm 91:14  Because he is bound to me in love, therefore will I deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my Name.
Psalm 91:15  He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I am with him in trouble; I will rescue him and bring him to honor.
Psalm 91:16  With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.
Psalm 92:1  It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, and to sing praises to your Name, O Most High;
Psalm 92:2  To tell of your loving-kindness early in the morning and of your faithfulness in the night season;
Psalm 92:3  On the psaltery, and on the lyre, and to the melody of the harp.
Psalm 92:4  For you have made me glad by your acts, O LORD; and I shout for joy because of the works of your hands.

Psalm 92:8  For lo, your enemies, O LORD, lo, your enemies shall perish, and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

Psalm 94:5  They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your chosen nation.
Psalm 94:6  They murder the widow and the stranger and put the orphans to death.
Psalm 94:7  Yet they say, “The LORD does not see, the God of Jacob takes no notice.”
Psalm 94:8  Consider well, you dullards among the people; when will you fools understand?
Psalm 94:9  He that planted the ear, does he not hear? he that formed the eye, does he not see?
Psalm 94:10  He who admonishes the nations, will he not punish? he who teaches all the world, has he no knowledge?
Psalm 94:11  The LORD knows our human thoughts; how like a puff of wind they are.
Psalm 94:12  Happy are they whom you instruct, O Lord! whom you teach out of your law;
Psalm 94:13  To give them rest in evil days, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
Psalm 94:14  For the LORD will not abandon his people, nor will he forsake his own.
Psalm 94:15  For judgment will again be just, and all the true of heart will follow it.

Psalm 94:17  If the LORD had not come to my help, I should soon have dwelt in the land of silence.
Psalm 94:18  As often as I said, “My foot has slipped,” your love, O LORD, upheld me.
Psalm 94:19  When many cares fill my mind, your consolations cheer my soul.
Psalm 94:20  Can a corrupt tribunal have any part with you, one which frames evil into law?
Psalm 94:21  They conspire against the life of the just and condemn the innocent to death.
Psalm 94:22  But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my trust.

Psalm 102:6  I have become like a vulture in the wilderness, like an owl among the ruins.
Psalm 102:7  I lie awake and groan; I am like a sparrow, lonely on a house-top.
Psalm 102:8  My enemies revile me all day long, and those who scoff at me have taken an oath against me.
Psalm 102:9  For I have eaten ashes for bread and mingled my drink with weeping.
Psalm 102:10  Because of your indignation and wrath you have lifted me up and thrown me away.
Psalm 102:11  My days pass away like a shadow, and I wither like the grass.
Psalm 102:12  But you, O LORD, endure for ever, and your Name from age to age.
Psalm 102:13  You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to have mercy upon her; indeed, the appointed time has come.

Psalm 102:15  The nations shall fear your Name, O LORD, and all the kings of the earth your glory.
Psalm 102:16  For the LORD will build up Zion, and his glory will appear.

Psalm 102:18  Let this be written for a future generation, so that a people yet unborn may praise the LORD.
Psalm 102:19  For the LORD looked down from his holy place on high; from the heavens he beheld the earth;
Psalm 102:20  That he might hear the groan of the captive and set free those condemned to die;
Psalm 102:21  That they may declare in Zion the Name of the LORD, and his praise in Jerusalem;
Psalm 102:22  When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms also, to serve the LORD.
Psalm 102:23  He has brought down my strength before my time; he has shortened the number of my days;
Psalm 102:24  And I said, “O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days; your years endure throughout all generations.
Psalm 102:25  In the beginning, O LORD, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;
Psalm 102:26  They shall perish, but you will endure; they all shall wear out like a garment; as clothing you will change them, and they shall be changed;
Psalm 102:27  But you are always the same, and your years will never end.
Psalm 102:28  The children of your servants shall continue, and their offspring shall stand fast in your sight.”
Psalm 103:1  Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.
Psalm 103:2  Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.
Psalm 103:3  He forgives all your sins and heals all your infirmities;

Psalm 103:5  He satisfies you with good things, and your youth is renewed like an eagle’s.

Psalm 103:10  He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.
Psalm 103:11  For as the heavens are high above the earth, so is his mercy great upon those who fear him.
Psalm 103:12  As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our sins from us.
Psalm 103:13  As a father cares for his children, so does the LORD care for those who fear him.
Psalm 103:14  For he himself knows whereof we are made; he remembers that we are but dust.
Psalm 103:15  Our days are like the grass; we flourish like a flower of the field;
Psalm 103:16  When the wind goes over it, it is gone, and its place shall know it no more.
Psalm 103:17  But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever on those who fear him, and his righteousness on children’s children;
Psalm 103:18  On those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments and do them.
Psalm 103:19  The LORD has set his throne in heaven, and his kingship has dominion over all.

Psalm 104:1  Bless the LORD, O my soul; O LORD my God, how excellent is your greatness! you are clothed with majesty and splendor.
Psalm 104:2  You wrap yourself with light as with a cloak and spread out the heavens like a curtain.
Psalm 104:3  You lay the beams of your chambers in the waters above; you make the clouds your chariot; you ride on the wings of the wind.
Psalm 104:4  You make the winds your messengers and flames of fire your servants.
Psalm 104:5  You have set the earth upon its foundations, so that it never shall move at any time.
Psalm 104:6  You covered it with the Deep as with a mantle; the waters stood higher than the mountains.
Psalm 104:7  At your rebuke they fled; at the voice of your thunder they hastened away.
Psalm 104:8  They went up into the hills and down to the valleys beneath, to the places you had appointed for them.
Psalm 104:9  You set the limits that they should not pass; they shall not again cover the earth.
Psalm 104:10  You send the springs into the valleys; they flow between the mountains.
Psalm 104:11  All the beasts of the field drink their fill from them, and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Psalm 104:12  Beside them the birds of the air make their nests and sing among the branches.
Psalm 104:13  You water the mountains from your dwelling on high; the earth is fully satisfied by the fruit of your works.
Psalm 104:14  You make grass grow for flocks and herds and plants to serve mankind;
Psalm 104:15  That they may bring forth food from the earth, and wine to gladden our hearts,
Psalm 104:16  Oil to make a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen the heart.
Psalm 104:17  The trees of the LORD are full of sap, the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,
Psalm 104:18  In which the birds build their nests, and in whose tops the stork makes his dwelling.
Psalm 104:19  The high hills are a refuge for the mountain goats, and the stony cliffs for the rock badgers.
Psalm 104:20  You appointed the moon to mark the seasons, and the sun knows the time of its setting.

Psalm 104:23  The sun rises, and they slip away and lay themselves down in their dens.
Psalm 104:24  Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until the evening.
Psalm 104:25  O LORD, how manifold are your works! in wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
Psalm 104:26  Yonder is the great and wide sea with its living things too many to number, creatures both small and great.
Psalm 104:27  There move the ships, and there is that Leviathan, which you have made for the sport of it.
Psalm 104:28  All of them look to you to give them their food in due season.
Psalm 104:29  You give it to them; they gather it; you open your hand, and they are filled with good things.
Psalm 104:30  You hide your face, and they are terrified; you take away their breath, and they die and return to their dust.
Psalm 104:31  You send forth your Spirit, and they are created; and so you renew the face of the earth.
Psalm 104:32  May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; may the LORD rejoice in all his works.
Psalm 104:33  He looks at the earth and it trembles; he touches the mountains and they smoke.

Psalm 105:3  Glory in his holy Name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
Psalm 105:4  Search for the LORD and his strength; continually seek his face.
Psalm 105:5  Remember the marvels he has done, his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,
Psalm 105:6  O offspring of Abraham his servant, O children of Jacob his chosen.
Psalm 105:7  He is the LORD our God; his judgments prevail in all the world.
Psalm 105:8  He has always been mindful of his covenant, the promise he made for a thousand generations:
Psalm 105:9  The covenant he made with Abraham, the oath that he swore to Isaac,
Psalm 105:10  Which he established as a statute for Jacob, an everlasting covenant for Israel,
Psalm 105:11  Saying, “To you will I give the land of Canaan to be your allotted inheritance.”
Psalm 105:12  When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in the land,
Psalm 105:13  Wandering from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another,
Psalm 105:14  He let no one oppress them and rebuked kings for their sake,
Psalm 105:15  Saying, “Do not touch my anointed and do my prophets no harm.”
Psalm 105:16  Then he called for a famine in the land and destroyed the supply of bread.
Psalm 105:17  He sent a man before them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
Psalm 105:18  They bruised his feet in fetters; his neck they put in an iron collar.
Psalm 105:19  Until his prediction came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him.
Psalm 105:20  The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free.
Psalm 105:21  He set him as a master over his household, as a ruler over all his possessions,
Psalm 105:22  To instruct his princes according to his will and to teach his elders wisdom.
Psalm 105:23  Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob became a sojourner in the land of Ham.
Psalm 105:24  The LORD made his people exceedingly fruitful; he made them stronger than their enemies;
Psalm 105:25  Whose heart he turned, so that they hated his people, and dealt unjustly with his servants.
Psalm 105:26  He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.
Psalm 105:27  They worked his signs among them, and portents in the land of Ham.
Psalm 105:28  He sent darkness, and it grew dark; but the Egyptians rebelled against his words.
Psalm 105:29  He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die.
Psalm 105:30  Their land was overrun by frogs, in the very chambers of their kings.
Psalm 105:31  He spoke, and there came swarms of insects and gnats within all their borders.
Psalm 105:32  He gave them hailstones instead of rain, and flames of fire throughout their land.
Psalm 105:33  He blasted their vines and their fig trees and shattered every tree in their country.
Psalm 105:34  He spoke, and the locust came, and young locusts without number,
Psalm 105:35  Which ate up all the green plants in their land and devoured the fruit of their soil.
Psalm 105:36  He struck down the firstborn of their land, the firstfruits of all their strength.
Psalm 105:37  He led out his people with silver and gold; in all their tribes there was not one that stumbled.
Psalm 105:38  Egypt was glad of their going, because they were afraid of them.
Psalm 105:39  He spread out a cloud for a covering and a fire to give light in the night season.
Psalm 105:40  They asked, and quails appeared, and he satisfied them with bread from heaven.
Psalm 105:41  He opened the rock, and water flowed, so the river ran in the dry places.
Psalm 105:42  For God remembered his holy word and Abraham his servant.
Psalm 105:43  So he led forth his people with gladness, his chosen with shouts of joy.
Psalm 105:44  He gave his people the lands of the nations, and they took the fruit of others’ toil,
Psalm 105:45  That they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Hallelujah!
Psalm 106:1  Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his mercy endures for ever.
Psalm 106:2  Who can declare the mighty acts of the LORD or show forth all his praise?
Psalm 106:3  Happy are those who act with justice and always do what is right!
Psalm 106:4  Remember me, O LORD, with the favor you have for your people, and visit me with your saving help;
Psalm 106:5  That I may see the prosperity of your elect and be glad with the gladness of your people, that I may glory with your inheritance.
Psalm 106:6  We have sinned as our forebears did; we have done wrong and dealt wickedly.
Psalm 106:7  In Egypt they did not consider your marvelous works, nor remember the abundance of your love; they defied the Most High at the Red Sea.
Psalm 106:8  But he saved them for his Name’s sake, to make his power known.
Psalm 106:9  He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up, and he led them through the deep as through a desert.
Psalm 106:10  He saved them from the hand of those who hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psalm 106:11  The waters covered their oppressors; not one of them was left.
Psalm 106:12  Then they believed his words and sang him songs of praise.
Psalm 106:13  But they soon forgot his deeds and did not wait for his counsel.
Psalm 106:14  A craving seized them in the wilderness, and they put God to the test in the desert.
Psalm 106:15  He gave them what they asked, but sent leanness into their soul.
Psalm 106:16  They envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.
Psalm 106:17  The earth opened and swallowed Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
Psalm 106:18  Fire blazed up against their company, and flames devoured the wicked.
Psalm 106:19  Israel made a bull-calf at Horeb and worshiped a molten image;
Psalm 106:20  And so they exchanged their Glory for the image of an ox that feeds on grass.
Psalm 106:21  They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
Psalm 106:22  Wonderful deeds in the land of Ham, and fearful things at the Red Sea.
Psalm 106:23  So he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath from consuming them.
Psalm 106:24  They refused the pleasant land and would not believe his promise.
Psalm 106:25  They grumbled in their tents and would not listen to the voice of the LORD.
Psalm 106:26  So he lifted his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness,
Psalm 106:27  To cast out their seed among the nations, and to scatter them throughout the lands.
Psalm 106:28  They joined themselves to Baal-Peor and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
Psalm 106:29  They provoked him to anger with their actions, and a plague broke out among them.
Psalm 106:30  Then Phinehas stood up and interceded, and the plague came to an end.
Psalm 106:31  This was reckoned to him as righteousness throughout all generations for ever.
Psalm 106:32  Again they provoked his anger at the waters of Meribah, so that he punished Moses because of them;
Psalm 106:33  For they so embittered his spirit that he spoke rash words with his lips.
Psalm 106:34  They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them.
Psalm 106:35  They intermingled with the heathen and learned their pagan ways,
Psalm 106:36  So that they worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
Psalm 106:37  They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to evil spirits.
Psalm 106:38  They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, which they offered to the idols of Canaan, and the land was defiled with blood.
Psalm 106:39  Thus they were polluted by their actions and went whoring in their evil deeds.
Psalm 106:40  Therefore the wrath of the LORD was kindled against his people and he abhorred his inheritance.
Psalm 106:41  He gave them over to the hand of the heathen, and those who hated them ruled over them.
Psalm 106:42  Their enemies oppressed them, and they were humbled under their hand.
Psalm 106:43  Many a time did he deliver them, but they rebelled through their own devices, and were brought down in their iniquity.
Psalm 106:44  Nevertheless, he saw their distress, when he heard their lamentation.
Psalm 106:45  He remembered his covenant with them and relented in accordance with his great mercy.
Psalm 106:46  He caused them to be pitied by those who held them captive.
Psalm 106:47  Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy Name and glory in your praise.
Psalm 106:48  Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting; and let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah!
Psalm 107:1  Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, and his mercy endures for ever.
Psalm 107:2  Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.
Psalm 107:3  He gathered them out of the lands; from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
Psalm 107:4  Some wandered in desert wastes; they found no way to a city where they might dwell.
Psalm 107:5  They were hungry and thirsty; their spirits languished within them.
Psalm 107:6  Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
Psalm 107:7  He put their feet on a straight path to go to a city where they might dwell.
Psalm 107:8  Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy and the wonders he does for his children.
Psalm 107:9  For he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.
Psalm 107:10  Some sat in darkness and deep gloom, bound fast in misery and iron;
Psalm 107:11  Because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.
Psalm 107:12  So he humbled their spirits with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was none to help.
Psalm 107:13  Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
Psalm 107:14  He led them out of darkness and deep gloom and broke their bonds asunder.
Psalm 107:15  Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy and the wonders he does for his children.
Psalm 107:16  For he shatters the doors of bronze and breaks in two the iron bars.
Psalm 107:17  Some were fools and took to rebellious ways; they were afflicted because of their sins.
Psalm 107:18  They abhorred all manner of food and drew near to death’s door.
Psalm 107:19  Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
Psalm 107:20  He sent forth his word and healed them and saved them from the grave.
Psalm 107:21  Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy and the wonders he does for his children.
Psalm 107:22  Let them offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving and tell of his acts with shouts of joy.
Psalm 107:23  Some went down to the sea in ships and plied their trade in deep waters;
Psalm 107:24  They beheld the works of the LORD and his wonders in the deep.
Psalm 107:25  Then he spoke, and a stormy wind arose, which tossed high the waves of the sea.
Psalm 107:26  They mounted up to the heavens and fell back to the depths; their hearts melted because of their peril.
Psalm 107:27  They reeled and staggered like drunkards and were at their wits’ end.
Psalm 107:28  Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
Psalm 107:29  He stilled the storm to a whisper and quieted the waves of the sea.
Psalm 107:30  Then were they glad because of the calm, and he brought them to the harbor they were bound for.
Psalm 107:31  Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy and the wonders he does for his children.
Psalm 107:32  Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.
Psalm 107:33  The LORD changed rivers into deserts, and water-springs into thirsty ground,
Psalm 107:34  A fruitful land into salt flats, because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.
Psalm 107:35  He changed deserts into pools of water and dry land into water-springs.
Psalm 107:36  He settled the hungry there, and they founded a city to dwell in.
Psalm 107:37  They sowed fields, and planted vineyards, and brought in a fruitful harvest.
Psalm 107:38  He blessed them, so that they increased greatly; he did not let their herds decrease.
Psalm 107:39  Yet when they were diminished and brought low, through stress of adversity and sorrow,
Psalm 107:40  (He pours contempt on princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes)
Psalm 107:41  He lifted up the poor out of misery and multiplied their families like flocks of sheep.
Psalm 107:42  The upright will see this and rejoice, but all wickedness will shut its mouth.
Psalm 107:43  Whoever is wise will ponder these things, and consider well the mercies of the LORD.
Psalm 108:1  My heart is firmly fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and make melody.
Psalm 108:2  Wake up, my spirit; awake, lute and harp; I myself will waken the dawn.
Psalm 108:3  I will confess you among the peoples, O LORD; I will sing praises to you among the nations.
Psalm 108:4  For your loving-kindness is greater than the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
Psalm 108:5  Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, and your glory over all the earth.
Psalm 108:6  So that those who are dear to you may be delivered, save with your right hand and answer me.
Psalm 108:7  God spoke from his holy place and said, “I will exult and parcel out Shechem; I will divide the valley of Succoth.

Psalm 108:9  Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I throw down my sandal to claim it, and over Philistia will I shout in triumph.”
Psalm 108:10  Who will lead me into the strong city? who will bring me into Edom?
Psalm 108:11  Have you not cast us off, O God? you no longer go out, O God, with our armies.
Psalm 108:12  Grant us your help against the enemy, for vain is the help of man.
Psalm 108:13  With God we will do valiant deeds, and he shall tread our enemies under foot.
Psalm 109:1  Hold not your tongue, O God of my praise; for the mouth of the wicked, the mouth of the deceitful, is opened against me.
Psalm 109:2  They speak to me with a lying tongue; they encompass me with hateful words and fight against me without a cause.
Psalm 109:3  Despite my love, they accuse me; but as for me, I pray for them.
Psalm 109:4  They repay evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Psalm 109:5  Set a wicked man against him, and let an accuser stand at his right hand.

Psalm 109:12  Let his descendants be destroyed, and his name be blotted out in the next generation.
Psalm 109:13  Let the wickedness of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and his mother’s sin not be blotted out;
Psalm 109:14  Let their sin be always before the LORD; but let him root out their names from the earth;
Psalm 109:15  Because he did not remember to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy and sought to kill the brokenhearted.
Psalm 109:16  He loved cursing, let it come upon him; he took no delight in blessing, let it depart from him.
Psalm 109:17  He put on cursing like a garment, let it soak into his body like water and into his bones like oil;
Psalm 109:18  Let it be to him like the cloak which he wraps around himself, and like the belt that he wears continually.
Psalm 109:19  Let this be the recompense from the LORD to my accusers, and to those who speak evil against me.
Psalm 109:20  But you, O Lord my God, oh, deal with me according to your Name; for your tender mercy’s sake, deliver me.
Psalm 109:21  For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
Psalm 109:22  I have faded away like a shadow when it lengthens; I am shaken off like a locust.
Psalm 109:23  My knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh is wasted and gaunt.
Psalm 109:24  I have become a reproach to them; they see and shake their heads.
Psalm 109:25  Help me, O LORD my God; save me for your mercy’s sake.
Psalm 109:26  Let them know that this is your hand, that you, O LORD, have done it.
Psalm 109:27  They may curse, but you will bless; let those who rise up against me be put to shame, and your servant will rejoice.
Psalm 109:28  Let my accusers be clothed with disgrace and wrap themselves in their shame as in a cloak.
Psalm 109:29  I will give great thanks to the LORD with my mouth; in the midst of the multitude will I praise him;
Psalm 109:30  Because he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save his life from those who would condemn him.
Psalm 110:1  The LORD said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.”
Psalm 110:2  The LORD will send the scepter of your power out of Zion, saying, “Rule over your enemies round about you.
Psalm 110:3  Princely state has been yours from the day of your birth; in the beauty of holiness have I begotten you, like dew from the womb of the morning.”

Psalm 123:2  As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, and the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,

Psalm 123:4  Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy, for we have had more than enough of contempt,
Psalm 123:5  Too much of the scorn of the indolent rich, and of the derision of the proud.
Psalm 124:1  If the LORD had not been on our side, let Israel now say;
Psalm 124:2  If the LORD had not been on our side, when enemies rose up against us;
Psalm 124:3  Then would they have swallowed us up alive in their fierce anger toward us;
Psalm 124:4  Then would the waters have overwhelmed us and the torrent gone over us;

Psalm 129:7  Which does not fill the hand of the reaper, nor the bosom of him who binds the sheaves;
Psalm 129:8  So that those who go by say not so much as, “The LORD prosper you. We wish you well in the Name of the LORD.”

Psalm 131:4  O Israel, wait upon the LORD, from this time forth for evermore.
Psalm 132:1  LORD, remember David, and all the hardships he endured;
Psalm 132:2  How he swore an oath to the LORD and vowed a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
Psalm 132:3  “I will not come under the roof of my house, nor climb up into my bed;
Psalm 132:4  I will not allow my eyes to sleep, nor let my eyelids slumber;

Psalm 132:13  If your children keep my covenant and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their children will sit upon your throne for evermore.”

Psalm 132:15  “This shall be my resting-place for ever; here will I dwell, for I delight in her.
Psalm 132:16  I will surely bless her provisions, and satisfy her poor with bread.
Psalm 132:17  I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her faithful people will rejoice and sing.
Psalm 132:18  There will I make the horn of David flourish; I have prepared a lamp for my Anointed.
Psalm 132:19  As for his enemies, I will clothe them with shame; but as for him, his crown will shine.”
Psalm 133:1  Oh, how good and pleasant it is, when brethren live together in unity!
