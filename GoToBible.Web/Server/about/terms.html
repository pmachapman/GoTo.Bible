						<h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
						<p>
							By downloading or using the app, these terms will
							automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
							that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
							allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
							our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
							extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
							to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
							versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
							database rights and other intellectual property rights related
							to it, still belong to Conglomo Limited.
						</p> <p>
							Conglomo Limited is committed to ensuring that the app is
							as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
							reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
							its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
							charge you for the app or its services without making it very
							clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
						</p> <p>
							The GoTo.Bible app stores and processes personal data that
							you have provided to us, in order to provide our
							Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
							access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
							not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
							removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
							official operating system of your device. It could make your
							phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
							compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
							that the GoTo.Bible app won’t work properly or at all.
						</p> <div><p>
							  The app does use third party services that declare their own
							  Terms and Conditions.
							</p> <p>
							  Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service
							  providers used by the app

							You should be aware that there are certain things that
							Conglomo Limited will not take responsibility for. Certain
							functions of the app will require the app to have an active
							internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
							by your mobile network provider, but Conglomo Limited
							cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
							functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
							have any of your data allowance left.
						</p> <p></p> <p>
							If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
							should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
							mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
							be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
							the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
							other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
							responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
							charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
							(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
							you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
							using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
							received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
						</p> <p>
							Along the same lines, Conglomo Limited cannot always take
							responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
							make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
							battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
							Conglomo Limited cannot accept responsibility.
						</p> <p>
							With respect to Conglomo Limited’s responsibility for your
							use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
							bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
							updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
							to provide information to us so that we can make it available
							to you. Conglomo Limited accepts no liability for any
							loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
							relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
						</p> <p>
							At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
							currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
							both systems(and for any additional systems we
							decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
							and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
							using the app. Conglomo Limited does not promise that it
							will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
							and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
							installed on your device. However, you promise to always
							accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
							also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
							it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
							Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
							rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
							(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
							from your device.
						</p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
							We may update our Terms and Conditions
							from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
							periodically for any changes. We will
							notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
							Conditions on this page.
						</p> <p>
							These terms and conditions are effective as of 2021-09-27

							If you have any questions or suggestions about our
							Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact us
